Unique statistics tracking and visualization of user interaction. 

Data
----
By logging all user input in detail including timestamp and exact touch and
movement info, this app can track and visualize many variations of statistical 
analysis of the data. This in turn should provide the user an incentive to 
keep interacting with the app. In particular the user will be challanged to
predict their own behavior, or once the app has gathered enough information, 
the aggregate behavior of all other users in certain situations.

Challanges
----------
For example, the user will be shown an image and be asked to interact with it.
The app will gather the interactions and visualize these relative of agregate
interactions from other users. By ganerating a point system based on the users
interactions and that from others the user could be challanged to be "original"
by trying to interact as differently as possible from the baseline. Alternatively
the user could be asked to predict as close to possible from the baseline.

Rankings
--------
The many types of statistical information that can be generated from the 
data set should be used to visualize as many statistical rankings as possible.
The more ranking systems the user is presented with, the better chance that the
user will score high in some of them relative to the other players. 

Statistics
----------
Statistical ranking examples:
- number of clicks
- time played
- shortest response to a new challange
- average of all rankings
- average interactions per challange
- lowest and highest interactions 
- time spend reading the intro
- highest number of repeated challanges
- ...
